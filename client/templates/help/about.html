  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>An ex-pat living abroad saw the need for many to pray for the nations of
    the world so that they would turn their hearts and minds to God, and thus
     created Precari. Precari is to pray in Latin.</p>
    <p><b>Psalm 67</b><br />
      <sup>3</sup> May the peoples praise you, God;<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may all the peoples praise you.<br />
      <sup>4</sup> May the nations be glad and sing for joy,<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for you rule the peoples with equity<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and guide the nations of the earth.<br />
      <sup>5</sup> May the peoples praise you, God;<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may all the peoples praise you.<br />

    <li>Precari was built for anonymity so a user doesnâ€™t have to expose themselves,
      or those they are praying for.</li>
    <li>A user can quickly add an item for prayer, and another pray for it</li>
    <li>The requester and those praying can track the prayer count and leave comments</li>
    <li>The public tags/requests allow anyone to find and pray for them</li>
    <li>Precari was also created an as open source  platform written using
      <a href="https://www.meteor.com/" target="_blank">Meteor</a> (a node.js framework)
      that others can install on their own, and then run their own instance.
