  <h2>Using tags</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tags are how you build lists and organize your requests</li>
    <li>Private tags are only visible to you</li>
    <li>There is no limit to the number of tags you can add. (i.e. family, health, salvation).
      This request will show up in each of the lists.</li>
    <li>View your tags in the <a href="{{pathFor 'tagsPage'}}">tags</a> page</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The details</h3>
  <p>Tags are how you build lists and organize your requests. Instead of creating
    a list and adding requests to it, you create a request and add tags to it
    that correspond the list you want them to show up in.</p>
  <p>For example, you might have tags/lists for your colleagues, friends, and
    family. Additionally, you might have tags for those who are still unbelievers
    and those who are already believers. Let's say you work closely with Joe and
    Tom, but Joe is not a believer and you and Tom and witnessing to him. One
    request could be for Joe, with the tags of <i>colleagues</i> and
    <i>not yet believers</i> and separate request for Tom with the tags of
    <i>colleagues</i> and <i>believers</i>. If viewing the <i>colleagues</i> list,
    both show up. If viewing the <i>not yet believers</i> list, only Joe shows up.
