  <h2>Understanding visibility settings</h2>
  <p>Each prayer request can have a range of visibility settings from private
    (only to the logged in user) to public (shows up on the main page). The user
    can change the visibility permissions at any time and the effects take place
    immediately.</p>
  <p>Each request inherits the previous characteristic. For example, a request
    set to a visibility of <i>tag</i> is also viewable through a private URL.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Private:</b> The request is completely hidden and only you can see and access it</li>
    <li><b>Link:</b> These requests will not show up in a tag list, but only through a unique and private URL</li>
    <li><b>Tag:</b> These requests show in a tag list</li>
    <li><b>Public:</b> These requests show up on the main page and anyone using the site can see</li>
  </ul>
